Description: Provides a generalized method for printing tabular data within 
	the R environment in order to make the process of presenting high quality 
	tabular output seamless for the user.  Output is directed to the R graphics 
	device so that tables can be exported to any file format supported by the 
	graphics device. Utilizes a formula interface to specify the contents of 
	tables often found in manuscripts or business reports.  In addition, formula 
	interface provides inline formatting of the numeric cells of a table and 
	renaming column labels.
